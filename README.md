# WASM Game of life

A cellular automaton simulator written in Rust targetting WebAssembly.

## Setup

```sh
npm install @nealrame/wasm-game-of-life

## API

This is a toy project written for fun and to learn how to compile _Rust_ code
to target _WebAssembly_.

So I did not write any documention or tests yet.
